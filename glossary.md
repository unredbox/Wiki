# VMZ
Vertical Merchandise Zone. On most units, the rotating carousel will have two posts of a noticable color (often yellow) to signify this zone. Intended for loading new discs into the unit. The VMZ was added in place of the QLM (Quick Load Module) in kiosks with an additional (8th) deck for merchandising and added a small shallow plastic bin at the bottom of the kiosk to collect disks.


# HAL
Hardware Abstraction Layer. In essence, a system used to interact with all of the physical hardware in the kiosk. Runs motors to turn carousel, run the picker up and down, and interfaces with all sensors inside each assembly. Also can control ventilation / air conditioning systems in some kiosks.

# KFC
Kiosk Function Check, accessible via HAL Tester

# QLM
Quick Load Module. A red door located on bottom of the unit used to load/unload disks. This was later replaced with the VMZ. Essentially an oddly shaped brief case that would be slid into the kiosk through the lower door.

# Thins
Discs that are scheduled to be removed from the kiosk. Think of it in terms of "thinning the herd"
