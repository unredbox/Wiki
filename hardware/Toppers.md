This page is extremely WIP. If you have a topper or know of additional topper variants, please contribute.

Toppers were used to further accent the kiosks by playing content on digital screens or displaying title cards also found in lightboxes.

*Some toppers utilized standalone 3-prong cord and some utilized cord that plugs directly into the kiosk.*

# Production Toppers
These topper variants are ones that were actively deployed to the field and attached to active kiosks.
