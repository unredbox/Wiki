<h3>How to replace battery safely</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><u>MAKE SURE THE UPS IS UNPLUGGED BEFORE REPLACING THE BATTERY TO AVOID ELECTRIC SHOCK</u></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>There should be a Philips screw at the bottom of the UPS that should be undone to be able to slide the cover out</li>
  <li>Unplug the negative connector first, then positive connector.</li>
  <li>Take the replacement battery and plug the positive terminal to the red connector, then negative terminal to the black connector. Take caution as there is risk of electric shock since most capacitors have been down for a while</li>
  <li>Test the UPS by turning it on. If the screen shows, then battery replacement is done and the cover can go back on. If it still doesn't turn on, repair or replacement of the Tripplite may be required.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Disc Cases</h1>
<p>At least five versions of cases have been observed with differences apparently&nbsp;only being cosmetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One version, shown the lower left, includes a barcode on the reverse side: “RDBX00728.”</p>
<p>(The addition of the UPC code might have allowed a retailer to more easily sell a missing replacement case.)</p>
<p>There were employee cases that were marked Blue, Orange, and Red</p>

<h3>Employee Cases</h3>
<p>Employee cases were to indicate whether they were redeploys, redistributes, and thins. These may still be inside kiosks and is rare to find one of these.</p>
<h6>Grey</h6>
<p>Any discs after Grey were redeploys, which were removed and randomly added in other kiosks in the area. These were phased out in 2020 in favor of thinning redeploys instead</p>
<h6>Blue</h6>
<p>Any discs after Blue were redistributes, which another kiosk would ask for specific movies and were tracked as well which discs go to which kiosk asking for the disc.</p>
<h6>Orange</h6>
<p>Any discs after Orange were thins, which were shipped back to the company to either be destroyed, donated, or sold to retailers. Dollar Generals have been known to sell thinned out discs in good condition.</p>
