<ul>
  <li>Harder material</li>
  <li>Bigger cross-sectional diameter</li>

<h1>Disc Cases</h1>
<p>At least five versions of cases have been observed with differences apparently&nbsp;only being cosmetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One version, shown the lower left, includes a barcode on the reverse side: “RDBX00728.”</p>
<p>(The addition of the UPC code might have allowed a retailer to more easily sell a missing replacement case.)</p>
<p>There were employee cases that were marked Blue, Orange, and Red</p>

<h3>Employee Cases</h3>
<p>Employee cases were to indicate whether they were redeploys, redistributes, and thins. These may still be inside kiosks and is rare to find one of these.</p>
<h6>Grey</h6>
<p>Any discs after Grey were redeploys, which were removed and randomly added in other kiosks in the area. These were phased out in 2020 in favor of thinning redeploys instead</p>
<h6>Blue</h6>
<p>Any discs after Blue were redistributes, which another kiosk would ask for specific movies and were tracked as well which discs go to which kiosk asking for the disc.</p>
<h6>Orange</h6>
<p>Any discs after Orange were thins, which were shipped back to the company.</p>
