<p>Redbox deployed a fleet of digital video signage displays on their kiosks <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211202005234/en/Redbox-Deploying-Digital-Video-Signage-on-an-Expected-4000-Kiosks-Through-Partnership-With-Velocity-MSC-Expanding-Promotional-Capabilities">back in 2021</a>. These displays run Android and were used to run video advertisements for primarily TikTok. As of 2025, all kiosks no longer have an internet connection. As a result, these display units will fail to display anything, staying black forever. For this reason, many stores have unplugged them.</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>These displays are housed in a custom, metal box. The back and front of the display unit are secured using the same Camlock-type locks as the main kiosk door uses. It's unknown if it's the exact key as the kiosk itself. Both lock cylinders are keyed for A keys.</p>
<p>Internally, these signs use displays manufactured by Videri. They are model number VDS-30, hosting a 32 inch display. This display is a self-contained unit and therefore has no IO, only accepting power via a proprietary connector. Due to this, there is no way to utilize the display unit as a monitor or TV without hardware modifications.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Outside of 32" screens, these specs possibly vary. Notably, these display units utilize LCDs with no backlight assembly. This means they have a custom backlight solution, so they cannot be entirely driven by a generic test board.</p>
<p>Here are the known panel models as well as their specs.</p>
<p>Todo: info</p>
<h1>Factory Software</h1>
<p>These panels run Android provided by Videri. The OS contains minimal apps and is very locked down normally and pretty secure. There's no way to gain access to the file system or anything on these devices without disassembling the device in its entirety. They will only connect to their pre-configured network in the wild.</p>
<p>It should be possible to install full AOSP Android on these devices in the future, installed over the internal USB port. Full firmware images have been found for these displays, which should make this quite easy. However, this has not been done yet.</p>
<p>It's possible to gain ADB access to these devices by reprovisioning them. You should follow Videri's instructions on factory resetting the device to get it to put up an Access Point. You may need to put the device onto the internet briefly for it to pull down a software upgrade if you can't get ADB access to work.</p>
<p>Once you've gained full ADB access to the device, you should be able to install apps onto it and disable iCanvasPlayer / AdSync. Once iCanvasPlayer is disabled, the provisioning website will no longer be available, so ensure that you have a way to enable it without accessing provisioning again. If not, you will have to factory reset the device.</p>
<p>You can use a reliable USB hub with a USB speaker and USB input device of some kind to control the device without ADB. You can use the device with Android USB TV Remotes as if it was an Android TV, assuming you install the appropriate launcher, app store, and apps. Aptoide TV is recommended, though other options may exist.</p>
<h1>Disassembly Details</h1>
<p>The main casing is fixed to the kiosk via the same large, philips head screws the standard lightboxes are attached with.</p>
<p>The screen itself is meant to be retained by both the locks, as well front metal bezel built out of polycarbonate and a metal of some kind. The internals are secured by both the front bezel panel and the rear door.</p>
<p>However, with minimal force, you may be able to remove the front bezel and rear door with a combination of lifting and turning the relevant doors. You should be able to defeat both locks with enough patience, though you can alternatively remove the plastic bezel from the front &nbsp;to speed things up.</p>
<p>The front bezel plastics are held in with Torx T20H screws. You may be able to gain better access to the internals via that route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The display itself is only retained by a bracket on the back of it. It can be lifted up and lowered out of the casing rather easily, though this is likely impossible on a fully assembled kiosk without having the door open.</p>
<p>To gain access to the internals, there are 4 12mm hex screws on the extreme corners of the display unit holding the red support bracket on that must be removed. Then, you can use a small Philips head screwdriver to remove the screws securing the top of the display unit. This will reveal the internal components of the display unit.</p>
