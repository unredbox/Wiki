<p>Redbox deployed a fleet of digital video signage displays on their kiosks <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211202005234/en/Redbox-Deploying-Digital-Video-Signage-on-an-Expected-4000-Kiosks-Through-Partnership-With-Velocity-MSC-Expanding-Promotional-Capabilities">back in 2021</a>. These displays run Android and were used to run video advertisements for primarily TikTok. As of 2025, all kiosks no longer have an internet connection. As a result, these display units will fail to display anything, staying black forever. For this reason, many stores have unplugged them.</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>These displays are housed in a custom, metal box. The back and front of the display unit are secured using the same Camlock-type locks as the main kiosk door uses. It's unknown if it's the exact key as the kiosk itself. Both lock cylinders are keyed for A keys.</p>
<p>Internally, these signs use displays manufactured by Videri. They are model number VDS-30, hosting a 32 inch display. This display is a self-contained unit and therefore has no IO, only accepting power via a proprietary connector. Due to this, there is no way to utilize the display unit as a monitor or TV without hardware modifications.</p>
<h2>Internal Android Device Specs</h2>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Outside of 32" screens, these specs possibly vary. Notably, these display units utilize LCDs with no backlight assembly. This means they have a custom backlight solution, so they cannot be entirely driven by a generic test board.</p>
<p>Here are the known panel models as well as their specs.</p>
<p>Todo: info</p>
<h1>Disassembly Details</h1>
<p>The main casing is fixed to the kiosk via the same large, philips head screws the standard lightboxes are attached with.</p>
<p>The screen itself is meant to be retained by both the locks, as well front metal bezel built out of polycarbonate and a metal of some kind. The internals are secured by both the front bezel panel and the rear door.</p>
<p>However, with minimal force, you may be able to remove the front bezel and rear door with a combination of lifting and turning the relevant doors. You should be able to defeat both locks with enough patience, though you can alternatively remove the plastic bezel from the front &nbsp;to speed things up.</p>
<p>The front bezel plastics are held in with Torx T20H screws. You may be able to gain better access to the internals via that route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The display itself is only retained by a bracket on the back of it. It can be lifted up and lowered out of the casing rather easily, though this is likely impossible on a fully assembled kiosk without having the door open.</p>
<p>To gain access to the internals, there are 4 12mm hex screws on the extreme corners of the display unit holding the red support bracket on that must be removed. Then, you can use a small Philips head screwdriver to remove the screws securing the top of the display unit. This will reveal the internal components of the display unit.</p>
