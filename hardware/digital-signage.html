<p>Redbox deployed a fleet of digital video signage displays on their kiosks <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211202005234/en/Redbox-Deploying-Digital-Video-Signage-on-an-Expected-4000-Kiosks-Through-Partnership-With-Velocity-MSC-Expanding-Promotional-Capabilities">back in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>These displays are housed in a custom, metal box. The back and front of the display unit are secured using the same Camlock-type locks as the main kiosk door uses. It's unknown if it's the exact key as the kiosk itself. Both lock cylinders are keyed for A keys.</p>
<p>Internally, these signs use displays manufactured by Videri. They are model number VDS-30, containing a 32 inch display.</p>
<h1>Disassembly Details</h1>
<p>The main casing is fixed to the kiosk via the same large, philips head screws the standard lightboxes are attached with.</p>
<p>The screen itself is meant to be retained by both the locks, as well front metal bezel built out of polycarbonate and a metal of some kind. The internals are secured by both the front bezel panel and the rear door.</p>
<p>However, with minimal force, you may be able to remove the front bezel and rear door with a combination of lifting and turning the relevant doors. You should be able to defeat both locks with enough patience, though you can alternatively remove the plastic bezel from the front &nbsp;to speed things up.</p>
