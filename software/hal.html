<p>The HAL on Redbox Kiosks is a suite of software that aid in communicating with the various hardware functions on the Kiosk. As many parts of the Kiosk communicate over COM serial ports, these applications act as an “Abstraction” on top of the complex serial communication between the various PCBs and devices on the kiosk.</p>
