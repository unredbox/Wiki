<h2>Kiosk Error Screens</h2>
<p>The basic error screens on a Redbox have different color backgrounds, indicating the problem at a basic level. Credits to @mordanthanus in the Discord for posting this info.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Black with white text</u> – Kiosk is booting or updating. Black screens automatically clear themselves when completed, usually 5-15 minutes. Watchdog must be turned on for this screen to disappear. Watchdog can be turned on or off through the Redbox Desktop.</li>
  <li><u>Red with white text</u> – Machine error alert. Check error codes further down on the page. Generally requires human intervention but may fix itself during an overnight reboot.</li>
  <li><u>Orange with white text</u> – Kiosk is conducting a partial or full maintenance sync and will reboot to customer screen when complete.</li>
  <li><u>Green with white text</u> – The kiosk engine reports a database access error and places kiosk into maintenance mode. SOFTFILE<i>0x errors.&nbsp;</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Kiosk Error Codes</h2>
<p>These error codes show on screen in maintenance mode. Credits to @mordanthanus in the Discord for posting this info.</p>
<p><code><strong>= 0073CDRR =</strong></code></p>
<p>- MS will always dispatch these due to an EMV error.</p>
<p><code><strong>= 0099CDRR =</strong></code></p>
<p>- Indication that the EMV has failed or been tampered with. Plan on bringing one with you. Alert Irruptions are not field repairable.</p>
<p><code><strong>= 0072CDRR =</strong></code></p>
<p>- EMV disconnected. If a remote reboot doesn’t fix it, a visit is needed.</p>

<h2>Powering On a Redbox Kiosk Computer After a BIOS Reset</h2>
<p>Redbox kiosk computers are configured to automatically power on when connected to a power source (autoboot). However, if the BIOS is reset—whether from a manual reset or due to a CMOS battery failure—this autoboot setting will revert to its default state and become disabled. After this, the computer will require a manual power-on each time until the autoboot setting is re-enabled in the BIOS.</p>
<h2>Locating the Power Button on Premio Computers</h2>
<p>On Premio computers, the power button is discreet and may not be immediately visible. It is located on the back of the unit, near the I/O panel. Look for a small button close to the I/O LEDs (typically used to indicate network or drive activity). Pressing this button will power on the computer, allowing access to the BIOS to re-enable the autoboot setting if needed.</p>
<p>Note: Once the autoboot on power setting is re-enabled in the BIOS, the computer should resume automatic boot-up on power connection, as originally configured.</p>
