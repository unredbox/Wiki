<h1>Extremely Laggy UI</h1>
<p>Some kiosks come configured with their GPU drivers disabled. This results in the user interface being exceptionally slow and choppy. Animations will stutter and tear, and overall it looks quite bad.</p>
<p>You can attempt to fix this by simply turning on the GPU drivers in Device Manager, accessible via <a href="/kioskengine/redbox-desktop">Redbox Desktop</a>. Techs have noted that this may not work and the device will simply not boot until you enter safe mode, though this doesn't appear to strictly be the case.</p>
<p>One potential route is using a DisplayPort to DVI cable or adapter and re-running the cable through the harness to the door if your VGA cable doesn't work. <strong>Note that Windows will take forever to boot the first time you do this</strong>, so give it 10-20 minutes before you give up and reset everything. It will seem like it's frozen, but it's not. If your disk activity light is out and the keyboard isn't responding, something may have went wrong.</p>

<h1>Titles Missing In Redbox Engine</h1>
<p>Kiosks have been reported to have issues where the titles in the engine disappear. The cause for this is still TBD. However, following the steps below should fix the unit to working order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Locate the profile.data files modified date. This file will be located in <code><strong>C:\Program Files\REDS\KioskEngine\Data\profile.data</strong></code></li>
  <li>Set the time and date of the machine to a date shortly after the modified date on the profile.data (Ex if the modified data is 7/23/24 set the date to mid-September 09/25/24)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>No Internet on Cellular Modem SIM</h1>
<p>Most, if not all, cellular modems come with Verizon 4G LTE plans. Over time, these SIM cards may become inactive or have already stopped working, rendering the cellular modem unusable. To restore functionality, you will need to replace the inactive SIM card with either an active one or a SIM card compatible with Verizon.</p>
<p>You have the following options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect the Ethernet cable—usually the black one—from the back of the computer, and connect your own Ethernet cable directly to your home router or switch (you could also purchase a WiFi extender with Ethernet capabilities and plug it directly into the LAN port).</li>
  <li>Install a PCIe wireless network card for your computer and connect to your local Wi-Fi network.</li>
  <li>Replace the old SIM card with another Verizon SIM card, or use a prepaid plan compatible with Verizon. (If choosing a prepaid plan, you will need the IMEI information from the cellular modem and a SIM kit.)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you may not want to expose your computer to the internet as it may cause complications in the future when software is no longer supported (or in case of being required to upgrade Windows 7). But, if you're planning on enabling SMB or installing your own VNC Server to access your kiosk over the internet, you'll have to connect it. To prevent any complications, you can setup Firewall Rules to expose certain ports for the computer, and restrict other hostnames (or, you can reject requests made from LAN -&gt; WAN to keep it available local-only).</p>

<h1>Gripper Calibrates, but Carousel Fails to Calibrate</h1>
<p>Ensure that the kiosk is positioned upright and completely level. Use a spirit level or similar tool to confirm it is not tilted in any direction. If the kiosk is leaning or uneven, adjust the leveling feet at the bottom to achieve proper alignment. Rotate the feet as needed to stabilize the kiosk and ensure it stands precisely at a 90-degree angle relative to the floor or base surface. Double-check the alignment and stability after adjustments to confirm it is secure and correctly positioned.</p>
