<h1>Extremely Laggy UI</h1>
<p>Some kiosks come configured with their GPU drivers disabled. This results in the user interface being exceptionally slow and choppy. Animations will stutter and tear, and overall it looks quite bad.</p>
<p>You can attempt to fix this by simply turning on the GPU drivers in Device Manager, accessible via <a href="/kioskengine/redbox-desktop">Redbox Desktop</a>. Techs have noted that this may not work and the device will simply not boot until you enter safe mode, though this doesn't appear to strictly be the case.</p>
<p>One potential route is using a DisplayPort to DVI cable or adapter and re-running the cable through the harness to the door if your VGA cable doesn't work. <strong>Note that Windows will take forever to boot the first time you do this</strong>, so give it 10-20 minutes before you give up and reset everything. It will seem like it's frozen, but it's not. If your disk activity light is out and the keyboard isn't responding, something may have went wrong.</p>

<h1>Titles Missing In Redbox Engine</h1>
<p>Kiosks have been reported to have issues where the titles in the engine disappear. The cause for this is still TBD. However following the steps below should fix the unit to working order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Locate the profile.data files modified date. This file will be located in <code><strong>C:\Program Files\REDS\KioskEngine\Data\profile.data</strong></code></li>
  <li>Set the time and date of the machine to a date shortly after the modified date on the profile.data (Ex if the modified data is 7/23/24 set the date to mid September 09/25/24)</li>
</ol>
