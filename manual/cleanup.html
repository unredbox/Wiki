<p>As the new owner of an abandoned Redbox kiosk, you've got a motorized, multi-hundred-pound steel box waiting to become a security risk in front of you. There are multiple things worth tweaking in your unit before you leave it to sit powered on for an extended period of time.</p>
<h1>Opening and cleaning out disks</h1>
<p>First of all, <strong>do NOT power the unit on. Doing so could cause damage to the kiosk and/or discs. </strong>To open the kiosk, you need to access the lock from the inside. To do this, you must remove the back cover. Indoor units use S02 Robertson (square) bits, and the outdoor units use H4 Security Hex, or T25 Security Torx bits. These screws line the outer edge of the back plate, and once removed, will allow the panel to be lifted off.</p>
<p>Once you have access to the unit, you need to remove as many discs as you can from deck 4 (the fourth platform from the top of the carousel) in order to reach through to the lock. During this process, make sure to remove disks that are likely jamming the carousel, ensuring that it can spin freely before powering the unit on, as it can easily cause problems if the carousel is stuck.</p>
<p>Once you have deck 4 cleared, it is recommended to use a flashlight set on the top of the carousel pointing down, or on deck 5, pointing at the lock. Once you can see the lock, look at the barrel on the front of the unit, and determine whether the arrow is pointing up, or down. If the arrow is pointing up, you need to depress the indent on the top of the barrel. If it is pointing down, you need to do it on the bottom. Use a flathead screwdriver to reach through deck 4, and depress the small square on either the top or the bottom of the barrel, depending on the direction of the arrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing this successfully will be audibly indicated, and the lock cylinder and handle should be extended from the housing. To open the door, turn the handle counter-clockwise until the door is fully unscrewed, which can then swing open.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>
<h2>Remove the Cellular Modem</h2>
<p>Every kiosk contains a cellular modem. This modem likely still has a data plan, meaning that any units with power are still connected to the internet. Removing this before powering the unit on has no consequences and should be done to ensure you don't expose the kiosk directly to the internet, especially if you're doing this in the future when these Windows 7 Embedded installs are extremely outdated.</p>
<h2>Disable or Uninstall Kaseya</h2>
<p>Kaseya was software Redbox used to help manage their kiosks remotely. This software only can be connected to via <code>accessredbox.net</code> servers. This domain is still registered at this time, though the eventual owner of this domain in the future could repurpose it into a malicious Command and Control server for any remaining kiosks connected to the internet. You should disable the Kaseya services in Service Management or otherwise uninstall it.</p>
<h2>Disable or Uninstall RealVNC</h2>
<p>RealVNC is installed on many Redbox kiosks, specifically RealVNC 4. This is a very old version of RealVNC and should be uninstalled or removed. You can disable it in Service Management or uninstall it fully.</p>
<h1>Clean Up</h1>
<h2>Remove old .log files</h2>
<p>It's recommended that all owners purge old .log files as they could contain some limited personal information of individuals who previously rented from a kiosk. If your kiosk has been down for several months when you power it on, the KioskEngine will automatically purge the old logs for you.</p>
