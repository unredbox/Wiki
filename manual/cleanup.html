<p>As the new owner of an abandoned Redbox kiosk, you're now responsible for a heavy, motorized steel unit that could become a security risk if left unattended. Before leaving it powered on for an extended period, there are several key adjustments worth making to ensure safety and reliability.</p>
<h1>Opening and Cleaning Out Disks</h1>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>DO NOT power on the unit</strong>. <strong>Doing so may cause damage to the kiosk and/or discs.</strong> To access the lock, you will need to open the back cover of the kiosk. Indoor units require an S02 Robertson (square) bit, while outdoor units use either H4 Security Hex or T25 Security Torx bits. These screws line the outer edge of the back plate, and once removed, the panel can be lifted off.</p>
<p>After gaining access to the unit, begin by removing as many discs as possible from deck 4 (the fourth platform from the top of the carousel) to reach the lock. During this process, make sure to clear any discs that may be jamming the carousel, as a stuck carousel can cause issues when powering the unit on.</p>
<p>Once deck 4 is cleared, it’s helpful to position a flashlight either on top of the carousel pointing downward or on deck 5, aiming at the lock. With proper lighting, observe the lock’s barrel on the front of the unit to determine the direction of the arrow. If the arrow points up, press the indent on the top of the barrel. If it points down, press the indent on the bottom. Use a flathead screwdriver to reach through deck 4 and depress the small square on either the top or bottom of the barrel, depending on the arrow’s direction.</p>
<p>A successful action will be indicated audibly, and the lock cylinder and handle should extend from the housing. To open the door, turn the handle counter-clockwise until the door is fully unscrewed and can swing open. Since some of these kiosks may have been sitting unopened at retailers for months, they might be difficult to open. We recommend applying grease or lubricant to the mechanism to make future openings easier.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>
<h2>Remove the Cellular Modem</h2>
<p>Each kiosk includes a cellular modem, which was previously used to maintain an internet connection. However, most data plans have been inactive since December 2024 due to non-payment, meaning the unit may not currently be online. Before reconnecting any kiosk to the internet, it’s strongly recommended to remove or disable vulnerable software such as Kaseya and RealVNC 4 to reduce security risks. These outdated tools could expose the system to potential threats. If still installed, the IBR200 modem can also be repurposed as a Wi-Fi extender, operating on the 2.4GHz band with a maximum speed of 60 Mbps.</p>
<p><strong>It is not recommended to connect systems running Windows 7 Embedded Standard (32-bit) to the internet.</strong> This operating system is no longer supported by Microsoft and does not receive security updates, leaving it highly vulnerable to modern exploits. Connecting it to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized access, malware infections, and data breaches—especially if legacy software like RealVNC 4 or Kaseya is still installed.</p>
<h2>Disable or Uninstall Kaseya</h2>
<p>Kaseya was used by Redbox for remote kiosk management. The software can only connect via the <code>accessredbox.net</code> servers, which is still registered at present. However, the domain could potentially be repurposed in the future by a malicious actor to serve as a Command and Control server for any kiosks still connected to the internet. To mitigate this risk, you should disable Kaseya services in Service Management or uninstall the software entirely.</p>
<h2>Disable or Uninstall RealVNC</h2>
<p>RealVNC 4, an outdated version of remote access software, is installed on many Redbox kiosks. This version has several security vulnerabilities due to weak authentication, lack of encryption, and other exploitable flaws such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These issues could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the kiosk, potentially compromising sensitive information or controlling the system remotely. Given that RealVNC 4 is no longer supported and lacks security updates, it is highly recommended to either uninstall RealVNC 4 entirely or disable the service through Service Management to mitigate any security risks.</p>
<h1>Clean Up</h1>
<h2>Remove old .log files</h2>
<p>It is recommended that all kiosk owners delete old .log files, as they may contain limited personal information from previous users. However, Redbox complies with PCIe standards for handling such information. If your kiosk has been inactive for several months, the KioskEngine application will automatically purge these old logs upon startup.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C:\Program Files\Redbox\KioskLogs\ErrorLogs</code></li>
  <li><code>C:\Program Files\Redbox\KioskShell\logs</code></li>
  <li><code>C:\Program Files\Redbox\REDS\DeviceService\logs</code></li>
  <li><code>C:\Program Files\Redbox\REDS\Kiosk Engine\logs</code></li>
  <li><code>C:\Program Files\Redbox\REDS\Update Manager\logs</code></li>
  <li><code>C:\ProgramData\Redbox\KioskClient\Logs</code></li>

</ul>
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<h2>Installing VNC Server</h2>
<p>If you've recently acquired a Redbox kiosk and want to tinker with your machine in the comfort of your own room, you may want to look into setting up a VNC server. A VNC server will allow you to remotely access and control your kiosk from any device, anywhere, which can save you the hassle of connecting a keyboard and mouse each time you need to access the machine. This is especially useful if your kiosk is placed in a less convenient location, like outdoors or in a cold garage. To start a VNC server on your kiosk, you'll need to choose one first. UltraVNC is highly recommended, as it works great on 32-bit devices and is easy to setup. First, <a href="https://uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html">visit this page</a> to download the latest version of UltraVNC Server (make sure to select the 32-bit architecture). Then, drag this executable on a USB stick and plug it into your kiosk.</p>
<p>Once you boot your kiosk, open the File Explorer and navigate to your external USB. Click on the executable to start the installation, and follow the instructions to set up your VNC server. When the installation is complete, navigate to <code>C:\Program Files\uvnc bvba\UltraVNC</code> and launch the <code>uvnc_settings.exe</code> file located in this folder. Here, you'll be able to configure your VNC server and setup a password for accessing it.</p>
<p>Then, apply all changes and restart your system. Once your system boots back up, you should be able to access your VNC Server at port 5900 (by default). Download a VNC Client on your devices (like RealVNC Viewer), and enter your kiosk's local IP address followed by the port. You should be able to connect without issues and access your kiosk on your network!</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> <i>If you want to access your kiosk outside of your network, you can setup port forwarding on your router to expose the 5900 port.</i></p>
<h2>Enabling SMB Protocol</h2>
<p>If you'd like to have the option of managing the files on your kiosk with ease, enabling the SMB1 protocol is a good choice. Similarly to setting up a VNC Server, SMB will allow you to access your kiosk's internal files without the need of navigating through File Explorer directly. Before enabling SMB, you'll need to create a new Administrator account or change the password for <code>Rbuser</code> to login. You can learn how to change the default Administrator password <a href="/en/manual/troubleshooting#changing-your-administrator-password">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have access to an Administrator account, open the Command Prompt on your kiosk and run the following command to enable SMB through the registry editor:<br><code>reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" /v SMB1 /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</code></p>
<p>This will create a registry record enabling SMB1 on your device. Before you continue, it's also recommended that you ensure SMB will start properly on boot. To do this, enter the Services Manager (<code>services.msc</code>) and look for the following services: <strong>Server</strong>, <strong>Workstation</strong>, and <strong>TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper</strong>. For each of these, right-click them and select Properties, and make sure that the Startup type is set to "Automatic". They most likely are, but if not, make sure to update them as so and start them afterwards if they aren't already.</p>
<p>Once you've enabled SMB and configured the start-up services, you'll want to grant permission to access the C:\ drive on your kiosk. Navigate to your C:\ drive in File Explorer and right-click on it, then select Properties. Click the Sharing tab, and select Advanced Sharing to open the permission manager. Tick the "Share this folder" option, and create a “Share name” to continue (you can name this whatever you'd like). Click the Permissions button below it, and check Allow for each option (Read/Write/Full Access), making sure the “Everyone” group is selected.</p>
<p>After doing this, you should be able to access your kiosk files through SMB! If you don't know how to do this already, you can use <a href="https://knowledgebase.45drives.com/kb/kb450446-connecting-to-smb-share-on-windows-and-macos/">this guide here</a>. When you're prompted to enter your credentials, use the login for your Administrator account that you setup before you started. That's it!</p>
<h2>Configuring Firewall</h2>
<p>If you want to enable functionalities like starting a VNC server, enabling the SMB protocol, or any other tasks that require a local network connection, you'll want to connect your kiosk to your home network. As you may already know, however, you may not want to expose your computer to the internet directly as it may cause complications in the future when software is no longer supported (or in the case of being required to upgrade Windows 7). To help minimize your risk to such complications, you can configure your router's firewall and disable access to WAN. If you don't have your kiosk connected to the internet already, you can follow the instructions <a href="/en/manual/quirks#no-internet-on-cellular-modem-sim">here</a>.</p>
<p>To do this, you'll need access to your router's administrator panel. This tutorial will be using OpenWRT, but most router's support this functionality in a similar way (the instructions may vary, however). First, login to your router's OpenWRT interface and go to <strong>Network &gt; Firewall &gt; Traffic Rules</strong>. Then, create a new forward rule with the “Source zone” set to LAN, and the “Destination zone” set to WAN. Then, update this forward rule to the following details:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Name: [enter any name here]<br>Restrict to address family: <strong>IPv4 and IPv6</strong> (default)<br>Protocol: <strong>TCP+UDP</strong> (default)<br>Source zone: <strong>LAN</strong> (default)<br>Source MAC address: [select your kiosk's MAC address here]<br>Source address: [select your kiosk's local IP address here]<br>Source port: <strong>any</strong> (default)<br>Destination zone: <strong>WAN</strong> (default)<br>Destination address: <strong>any</strong> (default)<br>Destination port: <strong>any</strong> (default)<br>Action: <strong>reject</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click the <strong>Save &amp; apply</strong> button below, and wait for the changes to propagate. Your kiosk should now have internet access restricted to only communicate devices in your local network.</p>
<h1>Outdoor Unit Outlet Rewiring Guide</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Electrical work must be performed with extreme caution and precision. If you are unsure about any part of this process, or lack the proper tools or experience, <strong>stop immediately and consult a licensed electrician.</strong> Improper wiring can result in <strong>serious injury, death, fire, and/or damage to kiosk equipment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guide is for individuals who plan to reuse the existing outlets within the kiosk. If you're not confident in completing this process, consider using an extension cord as an alternative. Make sure the cord supports at least 125V. Keep in mind that, depending on the type of cord used, it may obstruct the removal and reinstallation of the drop bin.</p>
<h2>Required Tools &amp; Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1x 12-AWG/2 or 12AWG/3 Power Cord (25ft)&nbsp;</strong><br>A thick, durable cable suitable for 20-amp circuits. The 25ft length should give you plenty of wire to work with inside the kiosk. You technically shouldn’t need more than 15 feet, but this allows you to have the proper lengths for daisy chaining from Outlet 1 to Outlet 2</li>
  <li><strong>1x GFCI Outlet Tester</strong>&nbsp;<br>Use this to verify that the outlet is properly wired and the GFCI protection works as intended.</li>
  <li><strong>1x 3/8" Clamp-on Service Entrance Connector</strong><br>Prevents stress or accidental tugging from damaging the internal wiring. Required for secure and safe cable entry into the box.</li>
  <li><strong>5x 12-10 Yellow Ring Terminals&nbsp;</strong><br>These will be crimped onto the ground wires to ensure a tight, secure, and corrosion-resistant connection to the outlets and chassis.</li>
  <li><strong>1x Wire Stripper/Cutter/Crimper Tool&nbsp;</strong><br>A basic model will do fine. Used to cut wire to length, strip the outer jacket, and crimp terminals to the exposed copper.</li>
  <li><strong>1x GFCI Outlet or 1x 20 Amp Circuit Breaker</strong>&nbsp;<br>Even though you're using 12 AWG wiring rated for 20 amps, GFCI outlets usually max out at 15 amps. Do not exceed the rated amperage.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp;For permanent or outdoor setups, you may want to install a dedicated 20- amp breaker. If you’re not experienced with electrical panels, hire a licensed electrician to handle this part.</li>
  <li><strong>1x 1/2" Plastic Screw-in Connector Conduit Fitting&nbsp;</strong><br>Optional, but great for helping keep moisture and rain out of the box, especially if the kiosk is outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional Parts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2x 20-Amp 125V Outlets (or better)&nbsp;</strong><br>Used if you're replacing both receptacles inside the kiosk.</li>
  <li><strong>1x 1/2" Plastic Screw-in Connector Conduit Fitting&nbsp;</strong><br>Optional, but great for helping keep moisture and rain out of the box, especially if the kiosk is outdoors. Most of the time, it is ok to re-use the old one, but is a good idea to use a new one to keep water from entering the kiosk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Disassemble the Electrical Box&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Unscrew and remove the two bolts holding the electrical box in place inside the kiosk.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Pull the box outward carefully to access the internal wiring.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove the Old Wiring&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Disconnect and discard all old wiring inside the box.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;You may need to cut the old green ground wire connected to the kiosk body. Don’t worry — you’ll replace it with fresh wire.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspect the Kiosk Entry Point&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Check the condition of the plastic screw-in fitting where the cable enters the kiosk. If damaged or missing, replace it to ensure weather resistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Feed in the New Power Cord&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Insert your 12AWG power cord through the back of the kiosk and into the box area.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Pull enough slack through to work comfortably and reach all terminals.</li>
  <li><strong>Strip the Outer Jacket&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Use the wire stripper to remove the outer black insulation from the cord — be careful not to nick the internal wires.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;You should see 3 wires inside: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Black or Red = Hot/Live&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - White = Neutral&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Green = Ground</li>
  <li><strong>Replace the Clamp Connector&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Remove the existing 3/8" clamp connector from the electrical box.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Install the new clamp connector and feed the stripped cable through it.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Tighten the clamp securely to prevent movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Jumper Wire&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Cut a short length of cable to connect the first outlet to the second outlet inside the box.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Leave extra length in case you ever need to remove or reposition the outlets.</li>
  <li><strong>Strip and Prep Wires</strong>&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Strip both ends of the jumper wire. Remove the black jacket and expose the individual wires.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Crimp a yellow ring terminal to the ground wire at both ends.</li>
  <li>Secure Cable and Connector<br>•&nbsp;Insert the power cord and jumper wire into the electrical box.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Tighten the clamp-on connector to hold everything in place.</li>
  <li>Tie the Underwriter’s Knot Before connecting wires to the GFCI or breaker:&nbsp;<br>• Create a loop in the hot and neutral wires.&nbsp;<br>• Intertwine them so they form a knot (this prevents tension from pulling on the terminals).&nbsp;<br>• Pull the knot tight and push it back into the box.</li>
  <li>Connect to Outlet 1&nbsp;<br>• Using the labeling on the outlet, connect:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Black wire or Red wire (Live) to the brass screw&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - White wire (Neutral) to the silver screw&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Green wire (Ground) with a ring terminal to the green screw</li>
  <li>Connect the Jumper to Outlet 2&nbsp;<br>• Repeat the connections using the jumper wire on Outlet 2:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Live to brass screw&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Neutral to silver screw&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ground (ring terminal) to green screw</li>
  <li>Install and Mount the Outlets&nbsp;<br>• Secure Outlet 1 (the back outlet) to the electrical box.&nbsp;<br>• Tighten the mounting screws and install the cover plate.</li>
  <li>Ground to Kiosk Frame&nbsp;<br>• Cut another length of ground wire to run from Outlet 2 to the metal frame of the kiosk.&nbsp;<br>• Crimp a ring terminal on both ends.&nbsp;<br>• Secure one end to the green screw on Outlet 2 and the other to the chassis ground point on the kiosk.</li>
  <li>Final Assembly&nbsp;<br>• Neatly tuck in the wires inside the box.&nbsp;<br>• Reattach the electrical box to the kiosk with the original bolts.&nbsp;<br>• Ensure everything is tight and sealed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Testing and Verification</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ensure all outlet connections are secure and tight before performing any tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>Plug in your GFCI Outlet Tester.</li>
  <li>Make sure each outlet shows correct wiring and that GFCI protection functions.</li>
  <li>If you get an error, double-check all wire connections, especially Live vs Neutral.</li>
  <li>Once everything tests correctly, plug in your kiosk equipment.</li>
</ol>
