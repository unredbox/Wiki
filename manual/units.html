<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>These units were installed on Outside units that were installed in 2005 after the Indoor units were found to be successful at a few test locations in 2004 under kiosks that were formally DVDPlay kiosks.</p>
<h2>Air Conditioner</h2>
<p>These machines were installed and used the a modified version of the IceQube IQ2200VS Air Conditioners. All manuals/parts are available on the <a href="https://iceqube.com/">IceQube website</a> and replacement parts have to be ordered over the phone. Expect the parts to be a bit pricey. Cheapest parts would to find used parts in another unit, but the guarantee of said parts to last is close to none.</p>
<h3>IQ2200VS Programming</h3>
<p>To enter programming mode on the IceQube IQ2200VS, use the password <strong>1234</strong> (note: some blue units may use <strong>1234321</strong>). If the password is accepted, the lights will indicate the current settings. Use buttons 1 and 2 to adjust values, and button 3 to move to the next section. When finished, press button 4 to exit programming mode. All changes made will apply to that specific controller.</p>
<p>If you tried both passwords and you are unable to get into programming mode, you will need to contact IceQube or swap the controller out from another kiosk's Unit.</p>

<h3>IQ2200VS Troubleshooting</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Always unplug the unit before troubleshooting or performing any maintenance to prevent electric shock. Even when unplugged, discharge any capacitors before touching internal components. Never attempt to bypass or modify the plug or internal wiring while the unit is connected to power.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><strong>3.10, 3.12, 3.14</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates a shorted sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>3.15, 3.16</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates supply voltage is either too high or too low.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Check power supply for high or low voltage condition. May indicate damage caused by power spike. If this is the case, a replacement of the unit is needed.</p>
<h6><strong>EC</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates a shorted condenser sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>EO</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates an open condenser sensor.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage and check that it is plugged into the rear of the controller. If plugged and still occurs, you will need to replace the condenser.</p>
<h6><strong>212</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates a shorted evaporator sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>CC</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates a shorted condenser sensor.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>C-O</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates an open condenser sensor.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage and check that it is plugged into the rear of the controller. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>C-C</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates a shorted condenser sensor.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Inspect the sensor cable for damage. If damaged, a replacement is required to clear this code.</p>
<h6><strong>Blank Display</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates loss of power to the controller or a defective controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Check the output voltage at the transformer secondary. The voltage should be a nominal 24 VAC. If the proper voltage is available at the transformer and the controller harness is secure to the controller, the controller is most likely faulty and will need replacement.</p>
<h6><strong>Flashing Cool LED</strong></h6>
<p>Indicates that the cooling has not been initiated. Within 3.5 minutes, the Cool LED should be lit continuously, and cooling should begin. When the Cool LED is lit continuously, the compressor and condenser blower should be operating.</p>
