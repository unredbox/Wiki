<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>These units were installed on Outside units that were installed in 2005 after the Indoor units were found to be successful at a few test locations in 2004 under kiosks that were formally DVDPlay kiosks.</p>
<h2>Air Conditioner</h2>
<p>These machines were installed and used the a modified version of the IceQube IQ2200VS Air Conditioners. All manuals/parts are available on the <a href="https://iceqube.com/">IceQube website</a> and replacement parts have to be ordered over the phone. Expect the parts to be a bit pricey. Cheapest parts would to find used parts in another unit, but the guarantee of said parts is close to none.</p>
